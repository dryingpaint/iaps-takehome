## Relevant Information from IAPS Content

### Overview of IAPS

The Institute for AI Policy and Strategy (IAPS) is a think tank focused on addressing the complexities and risks associated with advanced AI systems. It plays a significant role in AI governance and national security policy, providing research, policy recommendations, and strategic insights.

### Key Publications and Research Contributions

1. **"Secure Governable Chips"**: This publication introduces the concept of “on-chip governance,” which outlines security features on AI chips to mitigate national security risks from dual-use AI systems while protecting user privacy.

2. **Information Sharing on Dual-Use Capabilities**: IAPS describes a process for information-sharing on dual-use capabilities and makes recommendations for governments and industry to develop this process.

3. **AI Safety Institutes (AISIs)**: IAPS analyzes the first wave of AISIs, focusing on their characteristics and functions in the UK, the US, and Japan, which are tasked with governing the safety of advanced AI systems.

4. **AI Agent Governance**: This report provides an accessible guide to AI agent governance, analyzing the landscape of agents, their capabilities, and the risks posed by more agentic systems.

5. **Policy Memo on AI Assurance Technology**: Recommends that the UK government implement a market-shaping program to boost the AI assurance technology industry.

6. **Early Warning System for AI Threats**: Proposes that Congress should establish an early warning system for novel AI-enabled threats to provide maximal response time before public disclosure.

7. **Impact of High-End Consumer GPUs**: Analyzes the potential impact of consumer GPUs on US export controls on AI chips and makes policy recommendations.

8. **Location Verification Features for AI Chips**: Discusses the potential of adding location verification features to AI chips to enhance governance mechanisms and enforce export controls.

### Policy Positions and Recommendations

- **Information Sharing**: Emphasizes the need for structured information-sharing processes for dual-use AI capabilities.
- **AI Governance Frameworks**: Advocates for the development and implementation of AI governance frameworks to manage risks associated with advanced AI systems.
- **Export Controls**: Recommends enhancements to export controls through technology like location verification on AI chips.

### Recent Developments and Current Projects (2023-2024)

- **International Network of AI Safety Institutes**: IAPS is involved in discussions about the structure and coordination of this network, which aims to fit into the international governance landscape.
- **Response to Government Requests**: IAPS has submitted responses to various government requests for information, including those from NIST and the Department of Defense, focusing on AI model reporting and defense applications.

### Role in AI Governance and National Security Policy

IAPS plays a crucial role in shaping AI governance and national security policy by providing strategic insights, policy recommendations, and research contributions. It collaborates with international bodies and government agencies to address the challenges posed by advanced AI systems.
