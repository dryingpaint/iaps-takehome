# Research Report on the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy (IAPS)

## Introduction

The Institute for AI Policy and Strategy (IAPS) is a prominent think tank dedicated to addressing the complexities and risks associated with advanced AI systems. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of IAPS's policy frameworks, methodologies, and contributions to AI governance, distinguishing its approach from other institutions, and highlighting its engagement with various stakeholders.

## 1. Policy Frameworks and Methodologies Developed by IAPS

IAPS has developed several policy frameworks and methodologies to guide AI governance. Key areas of focus include AI policy and standards, compute governance, and international governance [Source 1](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/institute-for-ai-policy-strategy-general-support). Their methodologies often involve a combination of quantitative simulations, literature reviews, and expert interviews to assess AI-related risks and propose actionable solutions [Source 2](https://www.iaps.ai/research/are-consumer-gpus-a-problem-for-us-export-controls).

One notable framework is the "Secure Governable Chips" concept, which outlines security features on AI chips to mitigate national security risks while protecting user privacy [Source 4](https://www.iaps.ai/ourresearch). Additionally, IAPS has proposed technical solutions like location verification for AI chips to enhance export control effectiveness [Source 7](https://www.iaps.ai/research/location-verification-for-ai-chips).

## 2. Distinctive Approach of IAPS Compared to Other Think Tanks

IAPS distinguishes itself through its nonpartisan stance and commitment to intellectual independence, not accepting funding from for-profit organizations [Source 3](https://onthinktanks.org/job/director-of-government-affairs-institute-for-ai-policy-and-strategy-iaps). Unlike many think tanks, IAPS operates globally with a remote-first structure, allowing it to engage with a diverse range of stakeholders across different regions [Source 9](https://www.iaps.ai/research/introducing-iaps).

Furthermore, IAPS's focus on compute governance and its strategic emphasis on US-China AI relations set it apart from other institutions that may concentrate more on ethical or social implications of AI [Source 6](https://scholarships.af/organizations/institute-for-ai-policy-and-strategy-iaps/).

## 3. Concrete Policy Recommendations and Real-World Impact

IAPS has made several concrete policy recommendations, particularly in the realm of export controls and AI chip governance. For instance, they have advised the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to monitor consumer GPU flows and deny license exceptions for entities of concern [Source 2](https://www.iaps.ai/research/are-consumer-gpus-a-problem-for-us-export-controls). They also recommend implementing location verification features on AI chips to prevent smuggling and enhance export controls [Source 7](https://www.iaps.ai/research/location-verification-for-ai-chips).

The real-world impact of these recommendations is evident in the increased dialogue and policy adjustments concerning AI export controls, particularly in the context of US-China relations [Source 8](https://www.iaps.ai/research/china-aisi-counterparts).

## 4. Unique Contributions to AI Policy

IAPS is making unique contributions in several key research areas, including AI regulation, compute governance, and international governance. Their work on AI safety institutes and the development of AI assurance technologies are particularly noteworthy [Source 4](https://www.iaps.ai/ourresearch). IAPS's analysis of the international network of AI safety institutes and their role in global AI governance further highlights their unique contributions [Source 8](https://www.iaps.ai/research/china-aisi-counterparts).

## 5. Engagement with Government, Industry, and International Bodies

IAPS actively engages with government agencies, industry leaders, and international bodies to influence AI policy and governance. They maintain a strong presence in Washington, DC, and collaborate with institutions like the Oxford Martin AI Governance Initiative [Source 5](https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-ai-policy-and-strategy). Their Director of Government Affairs plays a crucial role in building relationships and representing IAPS in policy circles [Source 3](https://onthinktanks.org/job/director-of-government-affairs-institute-for-ai-policy-and-strategy-iaps).

## 6. Current Priority Projects and Future Directions

Current priority projects for IAPS include enhancing US AI standards and regulations, advancing compute governance, and addressing international governance challenges, particularly in relation to China [Source 9](https://www.iaps.ai/research/introducing-iaps). Future directions involve expanding their research on AI safety institutes and continuing to develop frameworks for AI assurance technologies [Source 4](https://www.iaps.ai/ourresearch).

## Summary/Conclusion

The Institute for AI Policy and Strategy (IAPS) plays a pivotal role in AI governance through its innovative policy frameworks, strategic focus on compute governance, and engagement with global stakeholders. By maintaining a nonpartisan and intellectually independent stance, IAPS effectively contributes to shaping AI policy and addressing the risks associated with advanced AI systems. Their ongoing projects and future directions indicate a continued commitment to enhancing AI governance and ensuring global stability in the face of rapid technological advancements.
