### Key Research Areas
IAPS has three primary research teams:
1. **AI Regulation**: Focuses on US AI standards, regulations, and legislation. They explore how an agency to regulate advanced AI should be set up and operate, and how AI regulations could be updated rapidly yet informed.
2. **Compute Governance**: Aims to establish empirical and theoretical grounding for compute governance, inform policy processes, and develop technical and policy proposals. Current focus includes US export controls on compute resources.
3. **International Governance & China**: Works on improving decisions at the intersection of AI governance and international governance or China, focusing on international governance regimes for frontier AI and China-West relations concerning AI.
