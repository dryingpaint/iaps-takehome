## Relevance to the Task

The content from the webpage is relevant to the task as it provides insights into the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy's (IAPS) policy recommendations, research methodologies, and its role in AI governance and national security policy. The document specifically addresses the use of consumer GPUs in circumventing US export controls, which ties into IAPS's focus on AI policy and strategy.

## Extracted Information

### Policy Recommendations and White Papers
- **Key Recommendations for BIS and Policymakers:**
  - Retain the distinction between data center and consumer GPUs while seeking to replace it with a technical classification.
  - Monitor and assess the flow of consumer GPUs to countries of concern.
  - Deny License Exceptions to listed entities and for consumer GPUs suitable for large AI workloads.
  - Require robust due diligence from US companies dominating the consumer GPU market.
  - Increase BISâ€™s budget to better equip it for its mission.

- **Recommendations for GPU Makers:**
  - Void warranties for consumer GPUs used in data centers.
  - Rescind support for consumer GPUs used in data centers.
  - Exercise heightened scrutiny when exporting high-end consumer GPUs.
  - Design consumer GPUs to be more distinct from data center GPUs.

### Research Methodologies and Frameworks
- **Methodology:**
  - The report uses quantitative simulations of consumer GPU stockpiling in various scenarios.
  - It combines these simulations with qualitative considerations, including literature reviews and expert interviews.

### Role in AI Governance and National Security Policy
- **AI Governance and Export Controls:**
  - The report discusses the implications of consumer GPUs in AI governance and national security, particularly concerning US export controls and the potential for Chinese actors to acquire these GPUs for AI development.

### Recent Developments and Current Projects (2023-2024)
- **Recent Focus:**
  - The report highlights recent trends in the use of consumer GPUs for AI workloads and the potential policy responses to mitigate risks associated with these trends.

### Key Insights and Quotes
- "Chinese actors are likely using US-designed consumer GPUs for small or moderate-size AI workloads today."
- "A well-resourced effort to acquire consumer GPUs could enable a supercomputer of hundreds of thousands or even millions of GPUs over the next ten years."
- "BIS should keep continuously monitoring and assessing the flow of consumer GPUs to countries of concern."

### Contextual Information
- The document provides a comprehensive analysis of the potential use of consumer GPUs in circumventing US export controls and the strategic implications for AI policy.
