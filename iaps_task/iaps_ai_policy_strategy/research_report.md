# Research Report: Institute for AI Policy and Strategy (IAPS)

## Introduction

The Institute for AI Policy and Strategy (IAPS) is a prominent think tank dedicated to addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This report provides a comprehensive overview of IAPS, detailing its mission, research areas, key personnel, publications, policy recommendations, and its role in AI governance and national security policy.

## Mission

IAPS is committed to mitigating risks associated with the development and deployment of advanced AI systems. Their mission is achieved through producing and sharing research that provides concrete recommendations based on strategic considerations and strengthening coordination and talent pipelines across AI governance fields. The institute maintains intellectual independence and does not accept funding from for-profit organizations, ensuring unbiased and technically sound policy research [Source 3](https://www.iaps.ai/introducing-iaps).

## Research Areas

### AI Security and Governance

IAPS focuses on creating secure and governable AI systems to mitigate national security risks. Key initiatives include the development of "Secure Governable Chips" and the establishment of AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) in countries like the UK, US, and Japan [Source 2](https://www.iaps.ai/ourresearch).

### Compute Governance

The institute explores the governance of computational resources, particularly focusing on the implications of consumer GPUs on US export controls. They provide policy recommendations to address scenarios of stockpiling and potential AI capabilities [Source 4](https://www.iaps.ai/research-and-blog).

### International Governance and Strategy

IAPS examines international governance issues, particularly in relation to China, and suggests topics for dialogues about advanced AI risks. They study the competition between the US and China in AI development and its global implications [Source 5](https://www.iaps.ai/).

### Policy and Standards

The institute evaluates government guidance and company policies on responsible AI scaling, comparing them to establish best practices. They also provide recommendations for information sharing on dual-use AI capabilities and early warning systems for AI-enabled threats [Source 2](https://www.iaps.ai/ourresearch).
