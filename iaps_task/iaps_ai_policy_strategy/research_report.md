# Institute for AI Policy and Strategy (IAPS): A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction
The Institute for AI Policy and Strategy (IAPS) is a leading think tank focused on understanding and navigating the transformative potential of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This report provides a detailed analysis of IAPS, covering its mission, organizational structure, research areas, leadership, publications, policy positions, role in AI governance, and recent developments.

## Mission, Goals, and Organizational Structure
The mission of IAPS is to maximize the societal benefits of AI while minimizing its risks. The organization aims to enhance national competitiveness, mitigate emerging risks, and foster innovation in AI governance and national security. IAPS emphasizes a collaborative approach to learning about AI's future and operates as a non-profit entity with intellectual independence, avoiding funding from for-profit organizations [Source 3](https://www.iaps.ai/research/introducing-iaps), [Source 5](https://www.iaps.ai/).

## Key Research Areas and Methodologies
IAPS's research is organized into several key areas:

1. **AI Policy and Standards**: The institute develops policies and standards for AI, focusing on regulatory frameworks and legislative structures in the U.S. [Source 1](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/institute-for-ai-policy-strategy-general-support).

2. **Compute Governance**: IAPS examines the governance of computational resources critical to AI development, including the impact of U.S. export controls on compute resources [Source 4](https://www.iaps.ai/research-and-blog).

3. **International Governance**: The organization focuses on international strategies and cooperation in AI governance, with particular attention to China-West relations [Source 3](https://www.iaps.ai/research/introducing-iaps).

4. **AI Security and Governance**: IAPS explores AI safety, including the development of secure AI chips and the governance of dual-use AI systems [Source 2](https://www.iaps.ai/ourresearch).

Methodologically, IAPS combines empirical and theoretical research to inform policy processes and debates, bridging the technical and policy worlds [Source 3](https://www.iaps.ai/research/introducing-iaps).

## Leadership Team and Key Personnel
