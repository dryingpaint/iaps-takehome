# INCOMPAS and Its Influence on AI Policy: Critical Evidence from the AICC Policy Framework

## Brief Summary

The analyzed document is the "AICC Policy Framework for Powering America’s AI Future," produced by the Artificial Intelligence Competition Center (AICC), an initiative of INCOMPAS. The report is a comprehensive policy proposal aimed at shaping U.S. AI policy across economic, infrastructure, national security, and legal domains. It positions INCOMPAS/AICC as a thought leader and advocate for open, competitive, and innovation-friendly AI policy.

**Relevance to Task:**  
The document provides direct insight into INCOMPAS/AICC’s policy positions, advocacy activities, and self-described role in the AI policy ecosystem. However, it offers limited concrete evidence of direct government contracts, grants, official advisory roles, or implementation of their recommendations. There are some references to participation in regulatory processes and citations in official comments, but little hard evidence of direct influence beyond policy advocacy and thought leadership.
