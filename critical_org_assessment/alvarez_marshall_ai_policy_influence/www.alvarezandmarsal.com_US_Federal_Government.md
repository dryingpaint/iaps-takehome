# Alvarez & Marsal Federal LLC: Critical Information for Assessing Influence on AI Policy

## 1. **Summary of Relevance to Task**

The Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) Federal Practice webpage provides some evidence of government contracts and consulting roles with federal agencies, references to AI and digital enablement in their service offerings, and brief case studies of federal projects. However, the page does **not** provide direct evidence of official advisory roles on AI policy, Congressional testimony, citations in policy documents, or details on funding sources, conflicts of interest, or peer/academic recognition. The information is largely self-promotional, with limited concrete evidence of direct influence on AI policy.
