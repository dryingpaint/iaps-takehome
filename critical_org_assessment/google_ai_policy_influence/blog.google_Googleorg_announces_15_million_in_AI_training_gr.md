## Context and Analysis

- **Influence Mechanism**: Google is not directly setting government policy but is shaping the AI skills, knowledge, and potentially the attitudes of a large swath of U.S. public sector workers and leaders through funding and curriculum development.
- **Expertise vs. Marketing**: The programs funded by Google.org are implemented by established organizations with government ties, not by Google itself, which may mitigate concerns about direct marketing or self-promotion.
- **Potential Conflicts of Interest**: While Google is not directly training government workers, its funding and the inclusion of Google Career Certificates in the curriculum may raise questions about indirect influence or bias toward Google’s AI tools and approaches.
- **Implementation Evidence**: The scale of training (tens of thousands of government workers) and the creation of a federal AI training center suggest real-world impact, not just publicity.
