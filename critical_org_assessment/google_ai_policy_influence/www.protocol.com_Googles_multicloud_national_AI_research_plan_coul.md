## Skeptical Questions: Evidence and Analysis

### Are they actually influential or just loud?

- **Evidence:** Google has a seat on the federal task force, submitted a major proposal, and is shaping the design of a national AI research infrastructure.
- **Conclusion:** Google is actually influential, not just vocal.

### Do they have real expertise or just marketing?

- **Evidence:** Google offers to provide technical services (data cleaning, Data Commons) and references its experience standardizing datasets.
- **Conclusion:** Google has technical expertise, but the offer of "free" services raises questions about motives and potential for self-dealing.

### What's their funding model - who pays them?

- **Evidence:** Google is seeking federal funding for NAIRR ($500M/year), but also stands to gain from access to government data and potential contracts.
- **Conclusion:** Google's funding model here is a mix of seeking public funds and leveraging the project for commercial advantage.

### Have their recommendations actually been implemented?

- **Evidence:** The project is in planning; Google’s recommendations are under consideration but not yet implemented.
- **Conclusion:** Too early to say, but Google is shaping the process.

### Are they cited by other credible sources?

- **Evidence:** Stanford’s AI Institute is cited in the same policy context, but Google’s proposals are being considered by the federal task force.
- **Conclusion:** Google is treated as a credible stakeholder by policymakers.

### Any conflicts of interest or bias?

- **Evidence:** Multiple experts raise concerns about Google’s motives:
    - *“Google’s proposal to do the job pro bono, said Eric Woods, research director at smart city technology research firm Guidehouse Insights, ‘raises the question of tech companies bearing gifts — what’s in it for them?’”*
    - *“If Google were to be chosen to process the data for the research hub, there are bound to be concerns about a commercial entity managing it, said Woods. ‘That’s exactly the debate that was going on around Sidewalk Toronto,’ he said.”*
- **Conclusion:** There are significant concerns about conflicts of interest and the potential for Google to gain privileged access to sensitive government data, which could benefit its commercial operations.
