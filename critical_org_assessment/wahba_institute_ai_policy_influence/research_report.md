# Research Report: Provide a CRITICAL assessment of Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition's actual influence on AI policy:

    REQUIRED ANALYSIS:
    1. REAL INFLUENCE: What concrete evidence exists of their policy impact? (Congressional testimony, government adoption of recommendations, etc.)
    2. CREDIBILITY: What are their actual credentials and expertise? Who are their leaders?
    3. FUNDING & BIAS: Who funds them? Any conflicts of interest?
    4. TRACK RECORD: What specific policy wins can they claim? What failed?
    5. PEER RECOGNITION: How do other credible experts view them?
    6. CRITICAL ASSESSMENT: Rate their actual influence as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW and explain why
    
    BE SKEPTICAL. Many organizations claim influence they don't have. Look for:
    - Concrete policy outcomes they influenced
    - Government officials who actually listen to them
    - Academic or peer recognition
    - Transparent funding and governance
    
    REJECT organizations that are:
    - Just corporate lobbying disguised as policy expertise
    - Self-promoting without real credentials  
    - Opaque about funding or governance
    - Making grandiose claims without evidence
    
    Keep assessment under 300 words. Be brutally honest.

# Critical Assessment of Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition’s Actual Influence on AI Policy

---

## 1. Real Influence: Evidence of Policy Impact

**No concrete evidence exists of direct policy impact by the Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition (WISC) on AI policy.**  
- There are **no records of Congressional testimony, government contracts, or official advisory roles** held by WISC or its representatives in the AI domain [Source 1](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wilson-center-launches-wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-to-shape-conversations-and-reforms-in-era-of-great-power-competition-301736237.html), [Source 2](https://bostonglobalforum.org/news/ai-diplomacy-in-a-divided-world-why-trust-will-define-the-digital-future/), [Source 3](https://bostonglobalforum.org/news/wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-and-boston-global-forum-host-roundtable-with-politburo-member-nguyen-xuan-thang-on-ai-strategies-and-tech-development-of-vietnam), [Source 4](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sadekwahba_the-wilson-centers-wahba-institute-for-strategic-activity-7135657450006867968-7_0P).
- WISC has **hosted and co-hosted roundtables** with international policymakers (e.g., WTO Global Forum, Vietnamese Politburo), but there is **no evidence that its recommendations have been adopted or cited by U.S. or foreign governments** [Source 2](https://bostonglobalforum.org/news/ai-diplomacy-in-a-divided-world-why-trust-will-define-the-digital-future/), [Source 3](https://bostonglobalforum.org/news/wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-and-boston-global-forum-host-roundtable-with-politburo-member-nguyen-xuan-thang-on-ai-strategies-and-tech-development-of-vietnam).

---

## 2. Credibility: Credentials and Leadership

- **Institutional Affiliation:** WISC is an initiative of the Wilson Center, a respected think tank, which lends some credibility [Source 1](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wilson-center-launches-wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-to-shape-conversations-and-reforms-in-era-of-great-power-competition-301736237.html).
- **Leadership:**
    - **Sadek Wahba, PhD:** Chair of WISC’s Steering Committee; PhD in economics (Harvard); member of President Biden’s National Infrastructure Advisory Council; former World Bank economist [Source 1](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wilson-center-launches-wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-to-shape-conversations-and-reforms-in-era-of-great-power-competition-301736237.html).
    - **Mark Kennedy:** Director; former U.S. Congressman; President Emeritus, University of Colorado; civic leader for the Secretary of the Air Force [Source 1](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wilson-center-launches-wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-to-shape-conversations-and-reforms-in-era-of-great-power-competition-301736237.html).
- **Expertise:** Leadership has strong policy and academic backgrounds, but **no evidence of technical AI expertise or peer-reviewed AI policy research** [Source 1](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wilson-center-launches-wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-to-shape-conversations-and-reforms-in-era-of-great-power-competition-301736237.html), [Source 2](https://bostonglobalforum.org/news/ai-diplomacy-in-a-divided-world-why-trust-will-define-the-digital-future/).

---

## 3. Funding & Bias

- **Funding:** WISC is funded by the Wahba Foundation, a private philanthropic entity associated with Sadek Wahba, who is also WISC’s chair [Source 1](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wilson-center-launches-wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-to-shape-conversations-and-reforms-in-era-of-great-power-competition-301736237.html).
- **Transparency:** No additional information on funding amounts, other donors, or governance is available. **Potential conflict of interest exists** due to the overlap between funder and leadership [Source 1](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wilson-center-launches-wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-to-shape-conversations-and-reforms-in-era-of-great-power-competition-301736237.html).
- **No evidence of corporate or lobbying funding, but lack of transparency is a concern.**

---

## 4. Track Record: Policy Wins and Failures

- **No specific policy wins or government adoptions** can be attributed to WISC in AI policy [Source 1](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wilson-center-launches-wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-to-shape-conversations-and-reforms-in-era-of-great-power-competition-301736237.html), [Source 2](https://bostonglobalforum.org/news/ai-diplomacy-in-a-divided-world-why-trust-will-define-the-digital-future/), [Source 3](https://bostonglobalforum.org/news/wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-and-boston-global-forum-host-roundtable-with-politburo-member-nguyen-xuan-thang-on-ai-strategies-and-tech-development-of-vietnam).
- **No evidence of failed policy initiatives**—but this is likely due to the institute’s newness and lack of track record, not transparency about failures.

---

## 5. Peer Recognition

- **Some signals of peer recognition**: WISC’s Director has spoken at Harvard’s Boston Global Forum and co-hosted events with the Wilson Center and Boston Global Forum, with participation from international officials and academics [Source 2](https://bostonglobalforum.org/news/ai-diplomacy-in-a-divided-world-why-trust-will-define-the-digital-future/), [Source 3](https://bostonglobalforum.org/news/wahba-institute-for-strategic-competition-and-boston-global-forum-host-roundtable-with-politburo-member-nguyen-xuan-thang-on-ai-strategies-and-tech-development-of-vietnam).
- **No evidence of citations by policymakers, academic publications, or formal recognition from leading AI policy experts.**

---

## 6. Critical Assessment: Actual Influence Rating

**Rating: LOW**

- **WISC is a new, well-connected initiative with credible leadership and access to policy forums, but there is no concrete evidence of direct influence on AI policy, government adoption of recommendations, or peer-reviewed expertise.**
- **Funding is non-transparent and potentially conflicted.**
- **WISC’s activities are currently limited to convening discussions and producing policy commentary, not shaping or implementing policy.**

---

## Summary/Conclusion

**The Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition has institutional credibility and access to high-level policy discussions, but there is no substantive evidence of direct influence on AI policy, government adoption of its recommendations, or recognized expertise in AI. Its funding lacks transparency and is closely tied to its leadership, raising questions about independence. At present, WISC’s actual influence on AI policy is best characterized as LOW.**
