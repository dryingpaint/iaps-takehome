## Skeptical Questions: Evidence and Analysis

### - **Are they actually influential or just loud?**
  - **Evidence of Influence:**  
    - Google is not just vocal; it has a seat on the federal task force, has submitted a detailed proposal, and is shaping the direction and funding of NAIRR.
    - *"Google has devised a detailed plan for how it could be built and how Google should be involved."*

### - **Do they have real expertise or just marketing?**
  - **Evidence of Expertise:**  
    - Google's technical proposal includes detailed operational recommendations (e.g., data cleaning, standardization, Data Commons).
    - However, the article also notes Google's self-promotion and the value it places on its own services.

### - **What's their funding model - who pays them?**
  - **Funding Model:**  
    - Google is advocating for **federal funding** ($500M+/year) for the NAIRR, with the potential for Google Cloud and other Alphabet divisions to benefit commercially.
    - Google offers some services "pro bono" (e.g., data cleaning), which raises questions about indirect benefits and access to valuable data.

### - **Have their recommendations actually been implemented?**
  - **Implementation Status:**  
    - The project is in the **planning stages**. Google's recommendations are under consideration by the task force and will be included in reports to Congress, but **no final implementation yet**.

### - **Are they cited by other credible sources?**
  - **Peer Engagement:**  
    - Google's proposals are discussed alongside those from Amazon, Microsoft, and Stanford’s AI Institute, indicating engagement with credible stakeholders.
    - The Stanford Institute's recommendations are cited as influential but also critical of opening the resource to private actors like Google.

### - **Any conflicts of interest or bias?**
  - **Potential Conflicts:**  
    - Google's desire for "first dibs" on government data and its offer to manage data cleaning for free are flagged by outside experts as potential conflicts:
      - *"Google’s proposal to do the job pro bono, said Eric Woods... 'raises the question of tech companies bearing gifts — what’s in it for them?'"*
    - The article notes that access to sensitive government data could benefit Google’s core business (search, maps, Sidewalk Labs) and give it power over how data is organized and accessed.
