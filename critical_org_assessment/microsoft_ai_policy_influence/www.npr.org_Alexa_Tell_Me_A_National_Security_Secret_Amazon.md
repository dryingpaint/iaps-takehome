- **AWS Government Contracts:**
  - AWS has contracts with multiple federal agencies, including the CIA and the Smithsonian.
  - AWS is described as "the favorite for a big-money Pentagon contract" (the JEDI contract, potentially worth up to $10 billion).
  - AWS's relationship with the CIA is highlighted as a major milestone: "For the IC (the intelligence community) and the CIA to trust Amazon with their data — and their secrets — is a big deal in government-contracting circles."
  - Estimated government business for AWS could reach "$3 billion to $4 billion annually in the next few years" (per Daniel Ives, GBH Insights).

    > "It's the best decision we've ever made... it is having a material difference or making a material difference and having a material impact on both CIA and the IC."
  - Defense Secretary Jim Mattis cited the CIA's AWS experience as a benchmark for Pentagon cloud modernization.

### 4. Track Record of Successful Policy Advocacy
