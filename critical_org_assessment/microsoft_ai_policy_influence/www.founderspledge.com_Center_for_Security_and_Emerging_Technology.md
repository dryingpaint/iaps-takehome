## Brief Summary

The content provides concrete evidence that CSET has played an advisory role in the development of US Department of Defense AI Principles, with two staff listed as consultants in official documentation. The organization is led by Dr. Jason Matheny, a former IARPA director, and has staff with government and academic experience. CSET is funded initially by Open Philanthropy and is based at Georgetown University, but details on ongoing funding are limited. While CSET is endorsed by Open Philanthropy as highly impactful, its overall influence and the implementation of its recommendations remain to be fully demonstrated due to its recent founding and limited public track record.
