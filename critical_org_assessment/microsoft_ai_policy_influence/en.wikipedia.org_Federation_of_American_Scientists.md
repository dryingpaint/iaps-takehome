# Federation of American Scientists (FAS): Critical Information for Assessing Influence on AI Policy

## Summary of Relevance
The Wikipedia article provides substantial information on the Federation of American Scientists’ (FAS) credibility, history of policy influence, funding, leadership, and recognition. While its most direct policy impact has historically been in nuclear security and government secrecy, there are signals of broader science and technology policy engagement, including AI. The article contains concrete evidence of FAS’s influence, expertise, funding sources, and recognition by policymakers, though direct evidence of AI policy implementation is limited.
