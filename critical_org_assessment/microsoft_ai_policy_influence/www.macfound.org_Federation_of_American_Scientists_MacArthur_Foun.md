## Summary of Relevance

The content from the MacArthur Foundation grants page for the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) provides **concrete evidence** of FAS's funding sources, history of policy engagement, and the nature of its work. While the grants are primarily focused on nuclear policy and security, the information is directly relevant to several credibility signals and skeptical questions about FAS's influence and expertise in policy, which can be extrapolated to their AI policy work. However, there is **no direct evidence** here about FAS's activities or influence specifically in AI policy, nor about government contracts, Congressional testimony, or direct implementation of recommendations.
