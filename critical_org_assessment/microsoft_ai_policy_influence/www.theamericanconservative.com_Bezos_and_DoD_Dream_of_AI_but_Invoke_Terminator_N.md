## Skeptical Questions Addressed

- **Are they actually influential or just loud?**
  - Evidence of direct influence: major government contracts, successful lobbying, and shaping procurement policy.
- **Do they have real expertise or just marketing?**
  - Amazon is providing operational AI and cloud services to top intelligence and defense agencies, indicating technical capability, but the article questions whether sufficient safeguards and oversight exist.
- **What’s their funding model—who pays them?**
  - Substantial revenue from U.S. government contracts (billions annually).
- **Have their recommendations actually been implemented?**
  - Yes; Amazon’s lobbying led to legislative changes (the “Amazon amendment”), and their technology is actively being piloted and deployed by government agencies.

  - Referenced in official DoD strategies and by high-level policymakers (e.g., James Mattis).
- **Any conflicts of interest or bias?**
  - Ongoing investigations into possible conflicts of interest in the JEDI contract process; concerns about the revolving door between Amazon and government.
