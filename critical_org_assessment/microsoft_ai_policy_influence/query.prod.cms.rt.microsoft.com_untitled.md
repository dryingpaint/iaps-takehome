# Microsoft Responsible AI Transparency Report (May 2024): Analysis for AI Policy Influence

## Brief Summary

This document is Microsoft's inaugural Responsible AI Transparency Report (May 2024), outlining their internal governance, risk management, and external engagement regarding AI development and deployment. The report provides some concrete evidence of Microsoft's participation in official frameworks, multi-stakeholder initiatives, and research funding, but lacks direct evidence of government contracts, Congressional testimony, or explicit citations in policy documents. It does, however, highlight Microsoft's leadership roles, partnerships, and transparency efforts, which are relevant to assessing their influence on AI policy.
