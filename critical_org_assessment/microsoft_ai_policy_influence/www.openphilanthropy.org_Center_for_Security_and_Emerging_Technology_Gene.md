## Conclusion

This grant page provides **concrete evidence** of CSET’s funding, leadership expertise, and institutional affiliation, all of which are strong credibility signals. However, it does **not** provide evidence of direct policy influence, government contracts, or implementation of recommendations. The information is highly relevant for assessing CSET’s credibility and potential for influence, but further research would be needed to evaluate their actual impact on AI policy.
