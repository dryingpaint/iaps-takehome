## **Contextual Notes**

- **AI Policy Relevance:** While the page does not focus exclusively on AI, the placement of FAS fellows in federal science and technology roles, and the involvement of Eric Schmidt (a major AI industry figure), strongly suggests FAS's activities are relevant to federal AI policy formation.
- **Potential Conflicts:** The funding and personnel pipeline between FAS, Schmidt Futures, and federal policy roles is a significant credibility and conflict-of-interest issue, especially in the context of AI policy.

---

## **Conclusion**

The InfluenceWatch page provides **concrete evidence** of FAS’s proximity to federal policymaking, its funding sources, leadership backgrounds, and controversies around influence and ethics. While direct evidence of specific AI policy influence or implementation is not detailed, the organization's role in staffing key federal science and technology positions (with funding from major tech philanthropists) is highly relevant for assessing its actual influence on AI policy.
