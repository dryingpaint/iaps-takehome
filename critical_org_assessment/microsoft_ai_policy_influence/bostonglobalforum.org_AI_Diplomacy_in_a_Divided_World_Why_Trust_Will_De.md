## 1. CREDIBILITY SIGNALS

### A. Government Contracts, Grants, or Official Advisory Roles

    - The remarks do not mention any government contracts, grants, or formal advisory roles held by the Wahba Institute.

### B. Testimony Before Congress or Other Official Bodies

- **Some evidence:**
    - The speaker is “Hon. Mark Kennedy, Director, Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition.”
