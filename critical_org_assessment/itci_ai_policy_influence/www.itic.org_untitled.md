## 1. **Summary of Relevance to Task**

This document is ITI’s formal response to a U.S. government Request for Information (RFI) from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) regarding the development of a national AI Action Plan. It provides direct evidence of ITI’s engagement with federal policymakers, outlines their policy recommendations, and references their ongoing involvement in shaping AI policy both in the U.S. and internationally. The content is highly relevant for assessing ITI's actual influence, credibility, and expertise in AI policy.
