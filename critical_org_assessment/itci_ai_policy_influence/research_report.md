# Research Report: Provide a CRITICAL assessment of Information Technology Industry Council's actual influence on AI policy:

    REQUIRED ANALYSIS:
    1. REAL INFLUENCE: What concrete evidence exists of their policy impact? (Congressional testimony, government adoption of recommendations, etc.)
    2. CREDIBILITY: What are their actual credentials and expertise? Who are their leaders?
    3. FUNDING & BIAS: Who funds them? Any conflicts of interest?
    4. TRACK RECORD: What specific policy wins can they claim? What failed?
    5. PEER RECOGNITION: How do other credible experts view them?
    6. CRITICAL ASSESSMENT: Rate their actual influence as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW and explain why
    
    BE SKEPTICAL. Many organizations claim influence they don't have. Look for:
    - Concrete policy outcomes they influenced
    - Government officials who actually listen to them
    - Academic or peer recognition
    - Transparent funding and governance
    
    REJECT organizations that are:
    - Just corporate lobbying disguised as policy expertise
    - Self-promoting without real credentials  
    - Opaque about funding or governance
    - Making grandiose claims without evidence
    
    Keep assessment under 300 words. Be brutally honest.

# Critical Assessment of Information Technology Industry Council’s (ITI) Actual Influence on AI Policy

## 1. Real Influence: Concrete Evidence of Policy Impact

ITI has provided formal recommendations to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) for the U.S. AI Action Plan, demonstrating direct engagement with federal policymakers. ITI claims ongoing collaboration with OSTP, NIST (notably on the AI Risk Management Framework), and participation in international standards bodies (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42) [ITI Comments to OSTP](https://www.itic.org/documents/artificial-intelligence/ITIResponsetoOSTPAIActionPlanFINALv2.pdf). However, there is no direct evidence in the document of Congressional testimony, explicit adoption of ITI’s recommendations by government agencies, or policymakers citing ITI as a source. The document references support for major initiatives (National AI Initiative Act, CHIPS Act), but lacks proof of ITI’s recommendations being implemented verbatim or of policymakers publicly crediting ITI.

## 2. Credibility: Credentials and Leadership

ITI demonstrates technical familiarity with AI policy, referencing international standards and best practices. It has published multiple policy frameworks (e.g., “AI Accountability Framework,” “Global AI Policy Recommendations”) [ITI Comments to OSTP](https://www.itic.org/documents/artificial-intelligence/ITIResponsetoOSTPAIActionPlanFINALv2.pdf). However, the document does not provide information about the academic or professional backgrounds of its leadership, nor does it mention whether staff have held government or technical roles. The only named contact is Courtney Lang, Vice President of Policy.

## 3. Funding & Bias: Sources and Conflicts of Interest

ITI is a membership-based organization funded by major information and communications technology (ICT) companies. The document states, “ITI represents the world’s leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies,” but does not disclose a full membership list, funding breakdown, or conflict-of-interest policies [ITI Comments to OSTP](https://www.itic.org/documents/artificial-intelligence/ITIResponsetoOSTPAIActionPlanFINALv2.pdf). This raises the likelihood of industry bias, as ITI’s positions may align with the commercial interests of its corporate members.

## 4. Track Record: Policy Wins and Failures

ITI claims to have influenced the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and supported the National AI Initiative Act and CHIPS Act [ITI Comments to OSTP](https://www.itic.org/documents/artificial-intelligence/ITIResponsetoOSTPAIActionPlanFINALv2.pdf). It has published frameworks and advocated for federal preemption in AI regulation. However, the document provides no direct evidence of specific ITI recommendations being adopted into law, nor does it cite any failed policy campaigns.

## 5. Peer Recognition: External Expert Views

There is no evidence in the document of ITI being cited by external experts, academics, or policymakers. No peer-reviewed recognition, academic citations, or independent validation of ITI’s expertise or influence is provided [ITI Comments to OSTP](https://www.itic.org/documents/artificial-intelligence/ITIResponsetoOSTPAIActionPlanFINALv2.pdf).

## 6. Critical Assessment: Influence Rating

**Influence Rating: LOW to MEDIUM**

**Rationale:**  
While ITI is a visible and active participant in AI policy discussions, providing detailed recommendations to federal agencies and referencing involvement in major policy initiatives, there is insufficient evidence of concrete policy outcomes directly attributable to ITI. The lack of transparency regarding funding, leadership credentials, and absence of external validation or Congressional testimony further limits its credibility. ITI functions primarily as an industry lobbying group, and its influence appears more advisory than determinative. Without clear evidence of government adoption of its recommendations or peer recognition, ITI’s actual policy impact should be rated as LOW to MEDIUM.

**Citation:**  
All claims and evidence are drawn from [ITI’s formal response to OSTP](https://www.itic.org/documents/artificial-intelligence/ITIResponsetoOSTPAIActionPlanFINALv2.pdf).

---

**Summary:**  
ITI is an active industry voice in AI policy, but lacks transparent evidence of decisive influence, independent credibility, or peer recognition. Its influence is overstated relative to the concrete policy outcomes demonstrated in the available evidence.
