# Research Report: Provide a CRITICAL assessment of HPE's actual influence on AI policy:

    REQUIRED ANALYSIS:
    1. REAL INFLUENCE: What concrete evidence exists of their policy impact? (Congressional testimony, government adoption of recommendations, etc.)
    2. CREDIBILITY: What are their actual credentials and expertise? Who are their leaders?
    3. FUNDING & BIAS: Who funds them? Any conflicts of interest?
    4. TRACK RECORD: What specific policy wins can they claim? What failed?
    5. PEER RECOGNITION: How do other credible experts view them?
    6. CRITICAL ASSESSMENT: Rate their actual influence as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW and explain why
    
    BE SKEPTICAL. Many organizations claim influence they don't have. Look for:
    - Concrete policy outcomes they influenced
    - Government officials who actually listen to them
    - Academic or peer recognition
    - Transparent funding and governance
    
    REJECT organizations that are:
    - Just corporate lobbying disguised as policy expertise
    - Self-promoting without real credentials  
    - Opaque about funding or governance
    - Making grandiose claims without evidence
    
    Keep assessment under 300 words. Be brutally honest.

# Critical Assessment of HPE’s Actual Influence on AI Policy

## 1. Real Influence: Concrete Evidence of Policy Impact

**There is no direct, concrete evidence that Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has influenced AI policy outcomes.**  
- No record of HPE providing Congressional testimony or being cited in official AI policy documents was found in the provided sources [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/hewlett-packard-enterprise/summary?id=D000067800), [HPE Political Engagement](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/living-progress/political-engagement-advocacy.html), [Subsidy Tracker](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/hewlett-packard-enterprise).
- HPE spends heavily on lobbying ($3.1M+ in 2023 and 2024), with over 70% of its lobbyists being former government officials—a sign of access, not proven policy impact [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/hewlett-packard-enterprise/summary?id=D000067800).
- HPE is active in trade associations (e.g., ITIC, TechNet) that influence tech policy, but no direct link to AI policy wins is documented [HPE Political Engagement](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/living-progress/political-engagement-advocacy.html).

## 2. Credibility: Credentials and Expertise

- HPE’s policy engagement is overseen by its Senior VP of Corporate Affairs and the Board’s Nominating, Governance, and Social Responsibility Committee [HPE Political Engagement](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/living-progress/political-engagement-advocacy.html).
- No evidence of AI policy expertise, academic credentials, or recognized thought leadership in AI policy among HPE’s leadership or staff [HPE Political Engagement](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/living-progress/political-engagement-advocacy.html).
- Heavy reliance on former government officials as lobbyists signals policy process expertise, not subject-matter authority [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/hewlett-packard-enterprise/summary?id=D000067800).

## 3. Funding & Bias: Sources and Conflicts

- HPE is a publicly traded corporation; its political activities are funded by corporate resources and voluntary employee PAC contributions [HPE Political Engagement](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/living-progress/political-engagement-advocacy.html).
- Receives significant government subsidies ($17.8M since 2000), which may create incentives to align policy positions with public funding interests [Subsidy Tracker](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/hewlett-packard-enterprise).
- All advocacy is explicitly business-driven, supporting HPE’s commercial objectives [HPE Political Engagement](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/living-progress/political-engagement-advocacy.html).

## 4. Track Record: Policy Wins and Failures

- No specific AI policy wins or implemented recommendations are documented in any source.
- No evidence of failed AI policy initiatives is present.
- HPE’s influence appears limited to general tech policy advocacy via lobbying and trade associations, not direct AI policy outcomes [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/hewlett-packard-enterprise/summary?id=D000067800), [HPE Political Engagement](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/living-progress/political-engagement-advocacy.html).

## 5. Peer Recognition

- No evidence of academic or peer recognition for HPE’s AI policy work.
- No citations by government officials or credible third-party experts [HPE Political Engagement](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/living-progress/political-engagement-advocacy.html).

## 6. Critical Assessment: Actual Influence Rating

**LOW.**  
HPE has substantial resources, access, and standard corporate lobbying infrastructure, but there is no concrete evidence of direct influence on AI policy, no recognized expertise, and no documented policy wins. Their activities are transparently business-driven, with potential conflicts due to government subsidies and revolving-door lobbyists. HPE is best characterized as a corporate actor seeking to protect its interests, not as a credible or influential AI policy authority.

---

**Summary:**  
HPE’s actual influence on AI policy is **low**. While they have access and resources, there is no evidence of direct policy impact, recognized expertise, or peer validation. Their engagement is typical of large tech firms—focused on lobbying and business-driven advocacy, not on shaping AI policy in a substantive or recognized way.
