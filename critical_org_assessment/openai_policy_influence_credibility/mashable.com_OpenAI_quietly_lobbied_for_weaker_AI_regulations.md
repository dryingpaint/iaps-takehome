#### **OpenAI's Lobbying Activities in the EU**
- **Concrete Evidence:**  
  - OpenAI produced a white paper (“OpenAI’s White Paper on the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act”) specifically aimed at influencing the EU’s AI Act.
  - The company lobbied to change the classification of “general purpose AI systems” (like GPT-3) from “high risk” to a less regulated category.
  - OpenAI argued that “GPT-3 is not a high-risk system, but possesses capabilities that can potentially be employed in high risk use cases.”
  - OpenAI’s position was that regulatory focus should be on companies using the models, not those training/providing them.

- **Outcome/Effectiveness:**  
  - The section of the EU AI Act that OpenAI lobbied against was ultimately removed from the final version of the law.
  - This indicates a **successful policy advocacy effort**: “OpenAI’s successful lobbying efforts likely explain Altman’s change of heart when it comes to OpenAI’s operations in Europe.”

- **Alignment with Other Tech Giants:**  
  - OpenAI’s lobbying positions were “aligned with Microsoft, Google” as they also sought to weaken the EU’s AI Act regulations.

#### **Testimony and Public Advocacy**
