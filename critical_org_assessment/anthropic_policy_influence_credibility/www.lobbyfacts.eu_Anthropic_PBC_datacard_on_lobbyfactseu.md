### Influence vs. Visibility

- **Concrete Evidence of Access:**  
  - Anthropic has met with high-level EU officials, including Commissioners and Cabinet members, on AI policy.
  - Invited to provide input on the AI Act and Code of Practice on GPAI.
- **Expertise:**  
  - Advisory role requested by EU officials, suggesting perceived expertise.
  - No evidence of formal policy implementation or citations in official documents.
- **Funding Model:**  
  - Only lobbying expenditures disclosed; no details on broader funding or investors.
- **Transparency:**  
  - Registered in the EU Transparency Register.
  - Discloses lobbying costs and activities, but not funding sources or leadership backgrounds.
- **Potential Conflicts of Interest:**  
  - Promotes own interests; no declared major contributions or intermediaries.

### Gaps and Limitations

## Conclusion

**Anthropic has demonstrable access to and engagement with high-level EU policymakers on AI regulation, especially the AI Act.**  
- Their influence is evidenced by repeated invitations to advise and participate in meetings with senior officials.
- However, there is no direct evidence of policy recommendations being implemented, nor of citations in official documents.
- Transparency is partial: lobbying costs are disclosed, but funding sources and leadership backgrounds are not.
- No evidence of government contracts, grants, or formal advisory appointments.

**Overall:** Anthropic is not just "loud"—they have real access and some advisory influence, but the extent of their impact on policy outcomes remains unproven based on this data.
