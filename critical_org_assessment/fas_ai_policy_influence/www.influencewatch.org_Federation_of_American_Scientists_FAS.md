## **5. Contextual Notes**

- **Tangential Relevance to AI**: While the content does not mention AI policy specifically, the FAS’s role in placing science and technology fellows in key federal positions is highly relevant to AI policy influence, given the overlap in personnel and policy domains.
- **Potential for Bias**: The close relationship with Schmidt Futures and the controversy over private sector influence are important for assessing the objectivity and independence of FAS policy work.

---

## **Conclusion**
**FAS demonstrates concrete influence on U.S. science and technology policy, including likely influence on AI policy, through the placement of fellows in key government roles and connections with major tech philanthropists. However, concerns about private sector influence, especially from Schmidt Futures, and lack of direct evidence of specific policy outcomes or Congressional testimony, warrant careful scrutiny.**
