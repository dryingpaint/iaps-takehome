## Skeptical Questions Addressed

### Are they actually influential or just loud?
**Evidence of Influence:**  
- Direct technical assistance on AI bills and other legislation
- Recommendations adopted or piloted by federal agencies (DOE, State Department)
- Placement of experts in government, including OSTP
- Cited in official reports and widely used reference documents (SIPRI, Ban Monitor)
- Sought out by Congress for briefings and support on AI policy

### Do they have real expertise or just marketing?
**Evidence of Expertise:**  
- Placement of technical fellows in federal agencies and the White House
- Staff and fellows with advanced degrees and policy experience
- Recognized as a go-to resource for technical advice on AI for Congress

### What's their funding model - who pays them?
**Funding Model:**  
- Mix of government contracts/grants and philanthropic funding
- Transparent funder list; most funding is project-restricted

### Have their recommendations actually been implemented?
**Implementation Evidence:**  
- State Department visa renewal pilot
- DOE guidance on flexible financial mechanisms
- Appropriations and program creation in federal legislation (NCADE, ARPA-I, Tech Hubs)
- VHA evaluation of pulse oximeters

### Are they cited by other credible sources?

### Any conflicts of interest or bias?
**Potential Conflicts:**
