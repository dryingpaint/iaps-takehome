# Research Report: Provide a CRITICAL assessment of Federation of American Scientists's actual influence on AI policy:

    REQUIRED ANALYSIS:
    1. REAL INFLUENCE: What concrete evidence exists of their policy impact? (Congressional testimony, government adoption of recommendations, etc.)
    2. CREDIBILITY: What are their actual credentials and expertise? Who are their leaders?
    3. FUNDING & BIAS: Who funds them? Any conflicts of interest?
    4. TRACK RECORD: What specific policy wins can they claim? What failed?
    5. PEER RECOGNITION: How do other credible experts view them?
    6. CRITICAL ASSESSMENT: Rate their actual influence as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW and explain why
    
    BE SKEPTICAL. Many organizations claim influence they don't have. Look for:
    - Concrete policy outcomes they influenced
    - Government officials who actually listen to them
    - Academic or peer recognition
    - Transparent funding and governance
    
    REJECT organizations that are:
    - Just corporate lobbying disguised as policy expertise
    - Self-promoting without real credentials  
    - Opaque about funding or governance
    - Making grandiose claims without evidence
    
    Keep assessment under 300 words. Be brutally honest.

# Critical Assessment of the Federation of American Scientists’ (FAS) Actual Influence on AI Policy

---

## 1. REAL INFLUENCE: Concrete Evidence of Policy Impact

FAS is **actively engaged** in AI policy circles, providing technical assistance to Congress on AI-related legislation and submitting formal recommendations to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) [FAS Annual Report 2023](https://fas.org/publication/fas-annual-report-2023/), [FAS AI Action Plan Submission](https://fas.org/publication/rfi-development-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-plan/), [Six Ideas for National AI Strategy](https://fas.org/publication/six-ideas-for-national-ai-strategy/). They claim involvement in shaping and supporting multiple AI bills, and their staff have briefed over 40 congressional offices. FAS recommendations have been partially adopted, such as the State Department’s pilot on visa renewal and DOE’s guidance on flexible financial mechanisms [FAS Annual Report 2023](https://fas.org/publication/fas-annual-report-2023/). However, **there is no direct evidence** of FAS being cited by name in enacted AI legislation, nor of Congressional testimony specifically on AI.

---

## 2. CREDIBILITY: Credentials and Leadership

FAS’s leadership includes CEO Dan Correa (former OSTP staffer) and board chair Gilman Louie (venture capitalist, presidential advisor) [InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/federation-of-american-scientists-fas/). Their staff and fellows have advanced degrees and policy experience, and FAS places technical fellows in high-level government roles, including OSTP [FAS Annual Report 2023](https://fas.org/publication/fas-annual-report-2023/). However, their AI-specific expertise is not always transparent, and detailed bios of AI policy staff are not consistently provided in public materials.

---

## 3. FUNDING & BIAS: Sources and Transparency

FAS is funded by a mix of major philanthropies (MacArthur, Gates, Hewlett, Schmidt Futures, Open Philanthropy), government agencies (USDA, USDOT, NSF), and individuals [FAS Financials](https://fas.org/about-fas/financials-funding/), [MacArthur Foundation](https://www.macfound.org/grantee/federation-of-american-scientists-1487), [Hewlett Foundation](https://hewlett.org/grants/federation-of-american-scientists-for-general-operating-support-3/). They disclose funders and provide IRS 990s, showing a high degree of transparency. However, significant funding from Schmidt Futures (Eric Schmidt) and government contracts raises potential concerns about independence, especially given media reports of FAS’s role in placing fellows in the Biden Administration [InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/federation-of-american-scientists-fas/).

---

## 4. TRACK RECORD: Policy Wins and Failures

FAS claims several policy “wins” in science and technology, including appropriations for ARPA-I, Regional Tech Hubs, and the National Center for Advanced Development in Education, as well as influencing DOE and State Department actions [FAS Annual Report 2023](https://fas.org/publication/fas-annual-report-2023/). In AI, they provided technical assistance on at least six bills and briefed dozens of congressional offices, but **no direct evidence exists that their AI-specific recommendations have been uniquely adopted or cited in law**. No major AI policy failures or lessons learned are disclosed.

---

## 5. PEER RECOGNITION: Reputation Among Experts

FAS is recognized by major funders and is sought out by policymakers for technical advice [FAS Annual Report 2023](https://fas.org/publication/fas-annual-report-2023/), [MacArthur Foundation](https://www.macfound.org/grantee/federation-of-american-scientists-1487), [Future of Life Institute](https://futureoflife.org/grant/federation-of-american-scientists-fas). Their nuclear policy work is widely cited (e.g., SIPRI Yearbook), but **there is little evidence of peer-reviewed publications, academic awards, or explicit recognition from leading AI policy scholars**. Their AI reputation is largely an extension of their broader science policy brand.

---

## 6. CRITICAL ASSESSMENT: Actual Influence Rating

**INFLUENCE RATING: MEDIUM**

**Rationale:**  
FAS is a credible, transparent, and well-networked organization with a proven track record in science and security policy. They are active in AI policy advocacy, provide technical assistance to Congress, and place fellows in influential government roles. However, **there is no concrete evidence that their AI policy recommendations have been uniquely adopted or that they have played a decisive role in shaping federal AI policy**. Their influence is real but diffuse—more as a respected participant and convener than as a policy driver. Potential conflicts of interest from major tech funders and government contracts warrant ongoing scrutiny.

---

## SUMMARY

FAS is a respected, well-funded science policy NGO with a history of government engagement and philanthropic support. In AI, they are active and credible contributors, but **their direct, unique influence on AI policy outcomes is moderate at best**. They are not a corporate lobbying front, and their funding is transparent, but their actual impact on AI policy is **significant but not dominant**.
