## Extracted Relevant Information

### 1. Funding Sources and Transparency

- **Grant Amount:** $200,000
- **Grantor:** The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation
- **Type of Support:** General Operating Support
- **Date Awarded:** 4/4/2023
- **Term:** 24 Months

---

### 2. Mission and Activities

- **Stated Mission:**  
  "The Federation of American Scientists believes that scientists, engineers, and other technically trained people have an ethical obligation to ensure that the technological fruits of science are applied to the benefit of humanity."
- **Key Activities:**  
  - Works to make government more accountable
  - Provides scientific knowledge to policymakers

**Implication:**  
FAS positions itself as a bridge between the scientific community and policymakers, aiming to inform government decisions with scientific expertise.

---

### 3. Policy Engagement and Initiatives

- **Congressional Science Policy Initiative:**  
  - Promotes better two-way communication to inform and educate Congress and the public on complex science and technology issues
  - Educates the science community on the workings of Congress

- **Day One Project:**  
  - Works with the executive branch to bring top-quality science talent into senior positions in executive agencies
  - Aims to strengthen the capacity to address science-related issues

**Implication:**  
These initiatives suggest FAS is actively engaged in policy circles, especially in facilitating science-policy communication and talent placement within the federal government. This is a credibility signal, though the content does not specify AI policy as a focus.
