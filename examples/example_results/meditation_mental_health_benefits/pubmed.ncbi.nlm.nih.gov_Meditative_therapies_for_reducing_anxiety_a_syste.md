## Relevance to Task

The content from the URL is highly relevant to the task of finding scientific research and evidence about meditation's positive effects on mental health, stress reduction, and well-being. The article is a meta-analysis focusing on the efficacy of meditation in reducing anxiety symptoms, which is a critical component of mental health and stress reduction.

## Summary of Content

### Background
- Anxiety disorders are common psychiatric conditions, and meditation is often used as a complementary therapy by patients with anxiety.
- The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of meditation specifically for anxiety, as previous reviews have focused on general health benefits.

### Methods
- The study conducted a thorough search of major medical databases using keywords related to meditation and anxiety.
- Over 1,000 abstracts were screened, and more than 200 full articles were reviewed.
- Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the analysis.
- The Boutron checklist was used to assess study quality, and 90% of authors were contacted for additional information.
- Review Manager 5 was used for meta-analysis.

### Results
- A total of 36 RCTs with 2,466 observations were included in the meta-analysis.
- The quality of the studies ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 on a 0.0-1.0 scale, with a mean of 0.72.
- Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for various comparisons:
  - SMD of -0.52 compared to waiting-list control (p < .001; 25 RCTs)
  - SMD of -0.59 compared to attention control (p < .001; seven RCTs)
  - SMD of -0.27 compared to alternative treatments (p < .01; 10 RCTs)
- Twenty-five studies reported statistically superior outcomes in the meditation group compared to control groups.
- No adverse effects were reported.

### Conclusions
- The review demonstrates some efficacy of meditative therapies in reducing anxiety symptoms, suggesting important clinical implications for using meditation in treating anxiety.
- Most studies measured improvements in anxiety symptoms rather than clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders.
