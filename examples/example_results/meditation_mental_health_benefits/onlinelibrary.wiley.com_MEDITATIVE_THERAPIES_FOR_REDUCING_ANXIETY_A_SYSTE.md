## Summary and Key Insights

### Overview
- **Objective**: The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of meditative therapies specifically for anxiety disorders through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
- **Methodology**: The research involved a thorough search of major medical databases, screening over 1,000 abstracts, and reviewing more than 200 full articles. Only RCTs were included, and the quality of these studies was assessed using the Boutron checklist.

### Results
- **Included Studies**: A total of 36 RCTs with 2,466 observations were included in the meta-analysis.
- **Study Quality**: The quality of the studies ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 on a scale of 0.0–1.0, with a mean of 0.72.
- **Effectiveness**: 
  - The standardized mean difference (SMD) was –0.52 when compared with waiting-list control (p < .001), –0.59 compared with attention control (p < .001), and –0.27 compared with alternative treatments (p < .01).
  - 25 studies reported statistically superior outcomes in the meditation group compared to control groups.
- **Adverse Effects**: No adverse effects were reported in the studies.

### Conclusions
- The review demonstrates some efficacy of meditative therapies in reducing anxiety symptoms, suggesting important clinical implications for using meditation in treating anxiety.
- However, most studies focused on symptom improvement rather than clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders.
